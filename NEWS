Version xxx
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: xxxx

Notes:
 * A dbus service is now used to handle the calls to the Digital Ocean API, rather than doing this directly from the Budgie panel.
 * Brand new Raven widget that allows the same functionality as the panel applet. The applet uses icons to be more "raven panel friendly"
 * Added the ability to sort the droplet list. Droplets can be sorted by name, by online first, and by offline first.
 * Sort method for applet and wirget can be set separately.
 * New icons - all icons have been custom designed for this applet and no longer use system or 3rd party icons.
 * Project restructured for better organization. It also possible to install just the applet or just the widget.
