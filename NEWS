Version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2023-08-08

Notes:
 * A dbus service is now used to handle the calls to the Digital Ocean API, rather than running threads on the Budgie panel.
 * Brand new Raven widget that allows the same functionality as the panel applet.
 * New custom created icons. Previous icons have been replaced. The applet no longer uses any system or 3rd party icons.
 * Applet now uses icons with tooltips to make the popover look more visually appealing.
 * Added the ability to sort the droplet list. Droplets can be sorted by name, by online first, and by offline first.
 * Sort method for applet and widget can be set separately.
 * Both applet and widget have an option to toggle the visibility of the SSH box.
 * Project restructured for better organization. It also possible to build and install just the applet or just the widget.
